# Cursor Templates Repository

This repository serves as a collection of specialized "user rules" and "commands" designed to enhance the capabilities of AI assistants, particularly for development and operations tasks.

## What's Inside?

This repository contains:

### Specialist User Rules
Detailed configurations that define various expert personas for the AI assistant. These rules enable the AI to adopt specific mindsets and expertise, such as:

- **Senior Performance & Security Monitoring Specialist**: Focuses on application observability, security monitoring, and incident response.
- **Senior QA Engineer & Unit Testing Specialist**: Concentrates on comprehensive test coverage, quality assurance, and defect prevention, emphasizing TDD, BDD, and shift-left testing.
- **Senior UX/UI Developer & Modern Frontend Specialist**: Specializes in modern, visually stunning, and user-centric frontend development, prioritizing user experience, visual impact, and accessibility.
- **Senior Web Application Security Architect**: Focuses on enterprise security architecture, threat modeling, and secure application design with a strategic security-first approach.

### Commands
A set of pre-defined actions or prompts that the AI assistant can execute. These commands streamline complex workflows and automate various development tasks, including:

- `/onboard`: Generates documentation like CODEBASE.md and PRESENTATION.md
- `/review`: Performs comprehensive code reviews covering security, performance, and best practices
- `/test`: Generates comprehensive test suites, including unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
- `/optimize`: Analyzes and optimizes code for performance, memory usage, and efficiency
- `/debug`: Provides systematic debugging assistance with root cause analysis and solutions
- `/deploy`: Generates deployment configurations and CI/CD pipeline setups

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this repository is to provide a centralized and version-controlled collection of these AI assistant configurations. By leveraging these templates, users can:

- **Enhance AI Assistant Capabilities**: Empower their AI assistants with specialized knowledge and predefined workflows for various software development roles
- **Improve Consistency**: Ensure consistent application of best practices and standards across projects by using standardized rules and commands
- **Accelerate Development Workflows**: Automate repetitive tasks and leverage expert-level guidance from the AI assistant
