## What’s Inside?

### 1. Specialist User Rules

Detailed persona configurations that let the AI adopt targeted mindsets and expertise:

- **Senior Performance & Security Monitoring Specialist** – application observability, security monitoring, and incident response.  
- **Senior QA Engineer & Unit Testing Specialist** – full test coverage and defect prevention, emphasising TDD, BDD, and shift-left testing.  
- **Senior UX/UI Developer & Modern Frontend Specialist** – modern, visually stunning, and accessible front-end experiences.  
- **Senior Web Application Security Architect** – enterprise-grade security architecture, threat modelling, and secure design with a security-first approach.
